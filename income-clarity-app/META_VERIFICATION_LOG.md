```markdown
### [TIME] - [Feature Name]
- **Task**: What was requested
- **Verified**: What was confirmed working
- **Updated**: 
  - Files/systems updated
  - Documentation updated
  - Context files updated

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before marking any task complete:
- [ ] Feature actually works (tested)
- [ ] Local CLAUDE.md updated
- [ ] MASTER_TODO_FINAL.md updated
- [ ] COMPLETED_FEATURES.md updated
- [ ] This log updated
- [ ] Tests pass

## RED FLAGS THAT NEED INVESTIGATION

If you see these patterns, the work might be duplicate:
- Agent says "Creating" something that sounds familiar
- Agent says "Implementing" basic features
- Agent reading lots of files to understand
- Agent not mentioning existing work
- Task seems too easy/basic

## QUICK VERIFICATION COMMANDS

```bash
# Check if feature exists
grep -r "FeatureName" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"

# Check recent modifications
find . -name "CLAUDE.md" -mtime -1 -exec grep -l "Recent Changes" {} \;

# Check completed todos
grep "âœ…" MASTER_TODO_FINAL.md

# Check for existing implementations
ls -la features/*/components/*Feature*
```
