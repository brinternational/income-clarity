## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### API Architecture:
```typescript
// Plan Type Definition
type PlanType = 'free' | 'premium';

// Database Schema (UserSubscription model)
- plan: 'FREE' | 'PREMIUM'  
- status: 'ACTIVE' | 'CANCELLED' | 'EXPIRED'
- features: JSON string with plan capabilities
- usage: JSON tracking for plan limits
```

### State Management:
```typescript
// React State
const [currentPlan, setCurrentPlan] = useState<'free' | 'premium'>('free');

// API Integration
fetchCurrentPlan() // Loads plan on component mount
handlePlanChange() // Updates plan and refreshes state
```

### Database Integration:
- Uses existing `UserSubscription` model in Prisma schema
- Automatic plan feature definition based on selected tier
- Persistent storage across user sessions
- Usage tracking for plan limits
