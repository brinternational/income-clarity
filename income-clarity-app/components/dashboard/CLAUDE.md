# Dashboard Components Directory

## Overview
This directory contains legacy dashboard components that are being migrated to Super Cards architecture.

## Recent Changes

### August 16, 2025 - Duplicate Component Cleanup
**CLEANUP COMPLETED**: Removed duplicate visualization components that were no longer used.

**Files Removed**:
- `DividendCalendar.tsx` (824 lines) - Duplicate of /components/charts/DividendCalendar.tsx
- `PerformanceChart.tsx` (347 lines) - Duplicate of /components/charts/PerformanceChart.tsx

**Reason for Removal**:
- The analytics page migration to Super Cards was completed
- All active imports point to the charts/ versions
- These duplicates were increasing bundle size unnecessarily
- No functional changes - application continues working perfectly

**Active Versions Location**:
- âœ… `/components/charts/DividendCalendar.tsx` (ACTIVE - used by Super Cards)
- âœ… `/components/charts/PerformanceChart.tsx` (ACTIVE - used by Super Cards)

**Verification Performed**:
- âœ… Comprehensive grep searches confirmed no active imports
- âœ… TypeScript compilation confirmed no broken imports
- âœ… Application tested and working correctly
- âœ… Super Cards continue functioning as expected

**Impact**:
- Bundle size reduced by ~1,171 lines of duplicate code
- No functional changes
- Cleaner codebase architecture
- Eliminated confusion about which components to use

## Remaining Components
All other components in this directory are still active and serve specific purposes in the legacy dashboard areas.

## Migration Notes
As Super Cards architecture becomes fully adopted, additional components may be migrated or deprecated from this directory.
