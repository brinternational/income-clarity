## Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

- [ ] All stabilization tests pass (≥95% pass rate)
- [ ] No critical performance regressions
- [ ] Memory usage within acceptable limits
- [ ] Database operations perform within thresholds
- [ ] Error handling and recovery work correctly
- [ ] Mobile performance meets standards
- [ ] Security calculations are accurate
- [ ] Data integrity is maintained under stress

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port Already in Use**
```bash
npm run port:kill
