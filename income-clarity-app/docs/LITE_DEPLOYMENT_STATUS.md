## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. **SSH Access**: Verify connection to 137.184.142.42
   ```bash
   ssh root@137.184.142.42
   ```

2. **Server Requirements**: Ubuntu/Debian with sudo access
3. **Network Access**: Allow outbound connections for API calls

### Quick Deployment
```bash
# 1. Check server status
bash scripts/check-production-server.sh

# 2. Deploy application
bash scripts/deploy-lite-production.sh

# 3. Verify deployment
curl https://incomeclarity.ddns.net/api/health-check
```

### Manual Deployment Steps
If automated deployment fails, follow these manual steps:

1. **Upload Files**:
   ```bash
   rsync -avz --exclude='node_modules' ./ root@137.184.142.42:/var/www/income-clarity-lite/
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   ssh root@137.184.142.42
   cd /var/www/income-clarity-lite
   npm ci --only=production
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.production.example .env.production
   # Edit .env.production with production values
   ```

4. **Start Application**:
   ```bash
   pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --env production
   pm2 save
   ```
