## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Database Service Layer
```typescript
SuperCardsDatabaseService
├── getPerformanceHubData() -> portfolios + holdings + calculations
├── getIncomeHubData() -> incomes + expenses + tax profiles  
├── getTaxHubData() -> tax profiles + strategy comparisons
├── getPortfolioHubData() -> portfolio health + risk analysis
└── getPlanningHubData() -> goals + snapshots + FIRE calculations
```

### Data Flow
```
Super Card Components
       ↓
superCardsAPI.fetch[Hub]()
       ↓  
superCardsDatabaseService.get[Hub]Data()
       ↓
Prisma ORM (SQLite queries)
       ↓
Local SQLite Database (prisma/income_clarity.db)
```

### Caching Strategy
- **L1 Cache**: In-memory service cache (5 minutes TTL)
- **L2 Cache**: Database query optimization
- **L3 Cache**: Prisma query engine caching
- **Fallback**: Mock data if database unavailable
