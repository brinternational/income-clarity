## Navigation Flow

### LOCAL_MODE Flow (Current)
```
Landing Page (/) 
  ↓
Dashboard (/dashboard/super-cards)
  ↓
Super Cards (Performance, Income, Tax, Portfolio, Planning)
  ↓
Settings/Profile (accessible but need header fix)
```

### Production Flow (When AUTH enabled)
```
Landing Page (/)
  ↓
Login/Signup (/auth/login or /auth/signup)
  ↓
Onboarding (/onboarding) - first time users
  ↓
Dashboard (/dashboard/super-cards)
  ↓
All features accessible
```

## Navigation Configuration
Created `/lib/navigation-config.ts` with:
- Centralized route definitions
- Mapping from old 18-card routes to new 5-card routes
- LOCAL_MODE detection helpers
- Navigation item generators

## Current Issues & Next Steps

### Issues to Fix:
1. **PWA Header not visible** in Super Cards (removed to fix duplicate header issue)
2. **Settings/Profile links** need to be accessible from Super Cards
3. **Bottom navigation** needs to be restored
4. **Authentication flow** needs testing when LOCAL_MODE is disabled

### Next Implementation Steps:
1. **Restore navigation header** in Super Cards without duplication
2. **Add settings/profile buttons** to Super Cards header
3. **Test auth flow** by disabling LOCAL_MODE
4. **Implement proper auth context** for production
5. **Connect onboarding flow** for new users

## How to Access Everything

### In LOCAL_MODE (current):
- Landing: http://localhost:3000/
- Dashboard: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/super-cards
- Settings: http://localhost:3000/settings (need to type URL directly)
- Profile: http://localhost:3000/profile (need to type URL directly)

### With AUTH (production):
- Will require login first
- All routes protected by RequireAuth wrapper
- Onboarding flow for new users

## Technical Changes Made

1. **Removed AppShell wrapper** from SuperCardsAppShell to fix CSS issues
2. **Removed all auth wrappers** in LOCAL_MODE
3. **Created professional landing page** with proper CTAs
4. **Fixed login page** to redirect to Super Cards
5. **Created navigation config** for centralized routing

## Files Modified
- `/app/page.tsx` - New landing page
- `/app/auth/login/page.tsx` - Fixed redirects
- `/app/dashboard/super-cards/page.tsx` - Removed auth wrappers
- `/components/SuperCardsAppShell.tsx` - Simplified without AppShell
- `/components/navigation/PWAHeader.tsx` - Updated with navigation config
- `/lib/navigation-config.ts` - New centralized navigation

## Summary
The core navigation structure is in place and working. The main remaining task is to properly integrate the navigation header into Super Cards so users can easily access Settings, Profile, and other features without typing URLs directly.
