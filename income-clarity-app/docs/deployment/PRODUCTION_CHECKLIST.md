## 🚀 Production Environment Setup

### Environment Variables Required
```env
# Supabase (Required)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_production_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_production_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_production_service_key

# Stock API (Required)
POLYGON_API_KEY=your_production_polygon_key
STOCK_API_PROVIDER=polygon

# Session Security (Required)
SESSION_SECRET=generate_secure_random_string_64_chars

```

### Database Migrations
1. Run MFA backup codes migration:
   ```sql
   -- Execute: supabase/migrations/20240101000000_mfa_backup_codes.sql
   ```

2. Verify all tables have RLS policies enabled
3. Ensure indexes are created for performance
