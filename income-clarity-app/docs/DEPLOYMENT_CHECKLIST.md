# ONE SERVER DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST
*Simplified for Solo Developer, Single Server Architecture*

## üéØ ONE SERVER APPROACH

**Income Clarity uses ONE SERVER for everything:**
- Live site: https://incomeclarity.ddns.net
- No dev/staging/prod separation (solo developer, pre-launch)
- Changes to code = immediate changes to live site
- PM2 manages the server (auto-restart on crash)
- **Deploy command**: `pm2 restart income-clarity`

This simplified checklist focuses on what matters for single-server deployment.

## üöÄ Quick Deploy (Most Common)

**For routine changes (80% of deployments):**

```bash
# 1. Quick verification (optional)
npm run type-check  # Verify TypeScript

# 2. Deploy instantly
pm2 restart income-clarity

# 3. Verify (optional)
curl https://incomeclarity.ddns.net/api/health
```

**That's it!** Changes are live in ~5-10 seconds.

## üîç Pre-Deploy Checks

### ‚úÖ Essential Checks (For Major Changes)

**Only run these for significant changes:**

```bash
# 1. TypeScript validation (recommended)
npm run type-check
# Expected: No TypeScript errors

# 2. Build test (for major changes)
npm run build
# Expected: Build succeeds

# 3. Quick test (optional)
npm test
# Expected: Core tests pass
```

**Quality Gates:**
- [ ] All TypeScript errors resolved
- [ ] No ESLint violations
- [ ] Security audit passes
- [ ] Code formatting consistent
- [ ] No console.log statements in production code

### ‚úÖ Simplified Testing (As Needed)

**Run tests only for significant changes:**

```bash
# For major changes only
npm run test:e2e  # Critical user flows
npm test          # Unit tests
```

**Testing Philosophy:**
- Quick changes: Deploy directly (rollback if issues)
- Major changes: Run E2E tests first
- Critical changes: Full test suite

### ‚úÖ Performance (Major Changes Only)

```bash
# Only for significant architectural changes
npm run build:analyze  # Check bundle size
```

## üöÄ PM2 Deployment

### ‚úÖ Standard Deployment Process

**Most deployments are this simple:**

```bash
# The magic command
pm2 restart income-clarity

# PM2 automatically:
# - Builds the app
# - Restarts the process
# - Handles zero-downtime restart
# - Maintains logs
```

**Build Verification:**
- [ ] Build completes without errors or warnings
- [ ] All static assets generated correctly
- [ ] Environment-specific configs loaded
- [ ] Bundle sizes within acceptable limits

### ‚úÖ PM2 Commands Reference

```bash
# Basic operations
pm2 restart income-clarity    # Deploy changes
pm2 status                   # Check status
pm2 logs income-clarity       # View logs
pm2 stop income-clarity       # Stop app
pm2 start income-clarity      # Start app

# Monitoring
pm2 monit                    # Real-time monitoring
pm2 show income-clarity       # Detailed info
```

### ‚úÖ Backup (Before Major Changes)

```bash
# Database backup (before significant changes)
cp prisma/income_clarity.db prisma/income_clarity.db.backup

# Code backup (automatic via git)
git add . && git commit -m "Backup before changes"
```

**Database Checklist:**
- [ ] Database server accessible
- [ ] Connection pooling configured
- [ ] All migrations applied successfully
- [ ] Schema matches Prisma schema
- [ ] Backup strategy verified
- [ ] Read replicas healthy (if applicable)

## ‚úÖ Post-Deploy Verification

### Quick Health Check

```bash
# 1. App is running
curl https://incomeclarity.ddns.net/api/health
# Expected: {"status": "ok"}

# 2. Check PM2 status
pm2 status
# Expected: income-clarity online

# 3. Check logs for errors
pm2 logs income-clarity --lines 20
# Expected: No critical errors
```

**Dependencies Checklist:**
- [ ] Polygon API accessible and within rate limits
- [ ] Yodlee API configured and responding
- [ ] Redis server accessible and responsive

### Deep Verification (Major Changes)

```bash

curl -X POST https://incomeclarity.ddns.net/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}'

# Dashboard test

- [ ] Required seed data present
- [ ] Data relationships intact
- [ ] Indexes properly created
- [ ] Foreign key constraints satisfied

## üîÑ Rollback (If Needed)

### Emergency Rollback

```bash
# 1. Stop current app
pm2 stop income-clarity

# 2. Restore previous version
git checkout HEAD~1  # Go back one commit

# 3. Restart
pm2 start income-clarity

# 4. Verify rollback
curl https://incomeclarity.ddns.net/api/health
```

### Database Rollback

```bash
# If database needs rollback
pm2 stop income-clarity
cp prisma/income_clarity.db.backup prisma/income_clarity.db
pm2 start income-clarity
```

### Quick Fix and Redeploy

```bash
# Fix the issue
vim path/to/broken/file.ts

## üéØ ONE SERVER PHILOSOPHY

**Simple is Better:**
- Solo developer, pre-launch = simple deployment
- One server = easy to debug, monitor, maintain
- PM2 = reliable process management
- Quick iterations = faster development

**When to Upgrade:**
- Multiple developers
- Customer base > 100 users  
- Revenue justifies staging environment

**Deploy with Confidence:**
