### 📋 Design System Components Used

```typescript
// Core Components
import { Button } from '@/components/design-system/core/Button';
import { Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent } from '@/components/design-system/core/Card';
import { Alert } from '@/components/design-system/core/Alert';

// Form Components  
import { TextField, EmailField } from '@/components/design-system/forms/TextField';
import { Select } from '@/components/design-system/forms/Select';
```

### 🎯 Next Priority Pages

#### Immediate Next Steps (Phase 2)
1. **Dashboard** (`/app/dashboard/super-cards/page.tsx`)
   - Replace buttons with Design System Button
   - Migrate super cards to Design System Card
   - Apply consistent spacing/grid

2. **Homepage** (`/app/page.tsx`)
   - Replace hero buttons with Design System Button
   - Use Design System layout components
   - Apply consistent typography

3. **Profile Page** (`/app/profile/page.tsx`)
   - Replace form components with Design System
   - Consistent layout and styling

### 📝 Recommendations

#### For Complete Migration Success
1. **Continue Systematic Approach**: Migrate page by page to maintain stability
2. **Test Each Phase**: Verify functionality after each page migration
3. **Document Changes**: Update CLAUDE.md files for each migrated section
4. **Monitor Performance**: Ensure Design System doesn't negatively impact load times

#### For Design System Enhancements
1. **Toggle Component**: Create a proper Toggle component for settings switches
2. **Loading States**: Enhance loading patterns across all components
3. **Animation Consistency**: Standardize motion and transitions
