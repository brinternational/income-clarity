# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL PORT PROTECTION RULE - READ FIRST

## â›” ABSOLUTE MANDATE - NEVER TOUCH THESE PORTS:
- **PORT 3000**: Income Clarity production server - NEVER KILL
- **PORT 22**: SSH connection to Claude Code CLI - NEVER KILL

## ðŸš« FORBIDDEN COMMANDS:
- `pkill -f node` (kills Claude Code CLI connection)
- `killall node` (kills everything)
- `npm run dev` with port changes
- Any command that kills ports other than 3000

## âœ… SAFE COMMANDS ONLY:
- `pkill -f custom-server.js` (targets specific server only)
