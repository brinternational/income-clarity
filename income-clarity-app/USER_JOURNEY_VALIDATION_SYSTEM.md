## 🚀 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION HIGHLIGHTS

### **Production Environment Focus** 🎯
```javascript
BASE_URL: 'https://incomeclarity.ddns.net'  // NEVER localhost
TEST_USER: { email: 'test@example.com', password: 'password123' }
ENVIRONMENT_VALIDATION: Blocks localhost attempts
```

### **Real User Workflow Testing** 👤
```javascript
// Authentic user interactions
- Real authentication flows
- Actual button clicks and form submissions
- Touch interactions for mobile testing
- Cross-device session management
- Error scenarios and recovery
```

### **Comprehensive Evidence Capture** 📸
```javascript
// Screenshot after every major step
await captureScreenshot(page, journeyName, stepName)

// Console error monitoring with zero tolerance
page.on('console', msg => {
  if (msg.type() === 'error') {
    errors.push({ message, severity, timestamp })
  }
})
```

### **Performance Benchmarking** ⚡
```javascript
// Journey step timing
const stepStart = Date.now()
// ... perform step ...
const duration = Date.now() - stepStart

// Thresholds validation
- Authentication: <5000ms
- Dashboard load: <3000ms
- Hero view: <2500ms
- Detailed view: <4000ms
```
