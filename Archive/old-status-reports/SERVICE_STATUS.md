## üîç TROUBLESHOOTING

### Service Won't Start
```bash
# Check for errors
sudo journalctl -u income-clarity -n 50

# Check port conflict

sudo systemctl start income-clarity
```

### Build Issues
```bash
# Clean build directory
rm -rf .next

# Rebuild
npm run build

# Restart service
sudo systemctl restart income-clarity
```

### Permission Issues
```bash
# Fix ownership
sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) /public/MasterV2/income-clarity/income-clarity-app

## üéØ BEST PRACTICES

### Do's
- ‚úÖ Always build before restarting service
- ‚úÖ Check logs after deployment
- ‚úÖ Monitor service status regularly
- ‚úÖ Keep systemd service file in sync with app changes
- ‚úÖ Use journalctl for debugging

### Don'ts
- ‚ùå Don't run `npm run dev` on production
- ‚ùå Don't stop service during peak hours
- ‚ùå Don't modify service file without daemon-reload
- ‚ùå Don't ignore service failure alerts
- ‚ùå Don't bypass systemd for production runs
