# Data Persistence Implementation Summary

## Date: 2025-08-04

### Implementation Overview

Successfully implemented local storage data persistence for Income Clarity app as a first step before Supabase integration.

### Key Components Added

#### 1. **Local Storage Service** (`lib/storage/local-storage.ts`)
- Type-safe localStorage wrapper
- Handles profiles, portfolios, and expenses
- Export/import functionality for backups
- Client-side only operations

#### 2. **useLocalStorage Hook** (`hooks/useLocalStorage.ts`)
- React hook for managing local storage data
- State management for all data types
- CRUD operations for all entities
- Loading states and data validation

#### 3. **DataPersistenceContext** (`contexts/DataPersistenceContext.tsx`)
- Context provider for app-wide data persistence
- Integrates with existing auth and portfolio hooks
- Auto-sync capabilities
- Export/import management

#### 4. **Settings Page** (`app/settings/page.tsx`)
- User interface for data management
- Export data as JSON backup
- Import data from backup files
- Clear all data option
- Future Supabase sync placeholder

### Features Implemented

✅ **Automatic Data Saving**
- Portfolio data persists on changes
- Expense data saved automatically
- Profile information stored locally

✅ **Data Export/Import**
- Download full backup as JSON
- Restore from backup files
- Date-stamped backup filenames

✅ **Data Management**
- View storage status
- Clear all data with confirmation
- Settings accessible from dashboard

✅ **Type Safety**
- Updated TypeScript interfaces
- Full type coverage for all operations
- Proper error handling

### How It Works

1. **Saving Data**: All data is automatically saved to localStorage when modified
2. **Loading Data**: On app start, data is loaded from localStorage if available
3. **Export**: Users can download their data as a JSON file from Settings
4. **Import**: Users can upload a previously exported JSON file to restore data
5. **Clear**: Users can delete all local data with a confirmation dialog

### Next Steps

1. **Supabase Integration** (Future)
   - Real database backend
   - Multi-device sync
   - Real-time updates
   - Secure cloud storage

2. **User Input Forms** (Next Priority)
   - Replace mock data with user inputs
   - Portfolio creation/editing
   - Expense tracking forms

3. **Data Validation**
   - Input validation on forms
   - Data integrity checks
   - Error recovery

### Testing Notes

- Local storage works immediately
- Data persists across sessions
- Export/import tested successfully
- Settings page accessible from dashboard menu

### Technical Details

- Uses browser's localStorage API
- Data stored as JSON strings
- No size limits for typical use
- Works offline
- Per-domain isolation
