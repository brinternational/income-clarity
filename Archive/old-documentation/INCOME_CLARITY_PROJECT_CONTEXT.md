##  CORE CONCEPT: DIVIDEND INCOME LIFESTYLE MANAGEMENT

**The Big Idea:** Optimize your portfolio to generate reliable monthly income that covers your bills

```
PORTFOLIO STRATEGY  DIVIDEND CALENDAR  MONTHLY INCOME  EXPENSE COVERAGE  GROWTH
```

**Not a FIRE calculator** - This is a **dividend income lifestyle optimizer** focused on:
1. **Location-based tax optimization** (PR vs CA vs TX - massive difference)
2. **Strategy comparison** (4% rule vs covered calls vs qualified dividends vs REITs)
3. **Dividend payment calendar** (when your "paychecks" arrive)
4. **Income scaling** (from $1k/month to $5k/month to financial stress relief)
5. **Tax planning** (set aside money before Jan 1st tax bill hits)

##  USER PSYCHOLOGY & EMOTIONAL DESIGN

### **Primary User Profile**
