## üìã Recommendation

**URGENT**: The dashboard is missing 6+ major components that already exist in the codebase. These should be integrated immediately as they provide core functionality that users expect.

**Task Assignment Needed**:
1. Extract components from `/app/working/page.tsx`
2. Integrate them into the dashboard
3. Ensure proper data flow with contexts
4. Test each component works with real data

The app has amazing features built but they're hidden in the `/working` page and not accessible to users through the main dashboard!
