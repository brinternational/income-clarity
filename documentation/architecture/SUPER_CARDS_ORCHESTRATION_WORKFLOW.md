# SUPER CARDS ORCHESTRATION WORKFLOW
*Updated Meta Orchestrator workflow for 5 Super Card architecture*
*Created: 2025-01-09*

## ðŸŽ¯ Meta Orchestrator Daily Workflow for Super Cards

### Step-by-Step Orchestration Process

```markdown
1. Read /RULES/README.md â†’ /RULES/rules.md â†’
   /RULES/context-management-rules.md â†’ /RULES/pm-rules.md

2. Read /income-clarity/SUPER_CARDS_BLUEPRINT.md to understand
   the 5 Super Card architecture

3. Read /income-clarity/SUPER_CARDS_MASTER_TODO.md and verify all
   Super Card features have todos

4. If any Super Card features are missing from master todo, add them

5. Identify top 5 CRITICAL/HIGH priority tasks from the Super Cards todo

6. Check /ACTIVE_TODOS/super-cards-todos.json for any in-progress work

7. Review your memory at /AGENT_MEMORY/claude-base/memory.md

8. Check your mailbox at /AGENT_MEMORY/mailbox/claude-base/inbox/

9. For each high-priority task, determine:
   - Can it be worked on now? (dependencies met?)
   - Which agent(s) should handle it?
   - Can multiple tasks run in parallel?

10. Create task context in /CONTEXT_MAP/ACTIVE_TASKS/[TASK-ID]/ with:
    - README.md (requirements for Super Card)
    - current-state.md (what exists in current implementation)
    - technical-spec.md (Super Card implementation plan)
    - component-mapping.md (old components â†’ Super Card mapping)
    - api-consolidation.md (how APIs will be merged)
```
