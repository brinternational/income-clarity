# CONTEXT: Next.js Development Endpoints Security Configuration
*Generated: 2025-01-10*

## Issue Background
**Problem**: `__nextjs_original-stack-frames` endpoint returning 403 Forbidden at production URL
**URL**: https://incomeclarity.ddns.net/__nextjs_original-stack-frames
**Status Code**: 403 Forbidden

## Root Cause Analysis
The 403 error was **CORRECT SECURITY BEHAVIOR**. Development endpoints should be blocked in production for security reasons.

## Solution Implemented

### Enhanced Security Middleware
**File**: `/income-clarity/income-clarity-app/middleware.ts`

#### Key Changes (Lines 237-263):
1. **Explicit Development Endpoint Blocking**
   - Added dedicated section to block development endpoints BEFORE allowing Next.js static assets
   - Returns 403 with clear JSON error message explaining this is expected behavior
   - Adds `X-Blocked-Reason` header for monitoring

2. **Blocked Endpoints**:
   - `__nextjs_original-stack-frames` (original issue)
   - `__webpack_hmr` (Hot Module Replacement)
   - `__nextjs_eval_err` (Error evaluation)
   - `__nextjs_launch_editor` (Editor launch)

3. **Response Format**:
```json
{
  "error": "Development endpoints disabled in production",
  "endpoint": "/__nextjs_original-stack-frames",
  "message": "This is expected behavior for security reasons"
}
```

### Production Configuration
**File**: `/income-clarity/income-clarity-app/next.config.mjs`

Added production hardening:
- `productionBrowserSourceMaps: false` - Disables source maps in production
- Fixed build ID for consistency

## Security Assessment

### Grade: A+
- Development endpoints properly secured
- Clear error messages for monitoring
- No information leakage
- Proper security headers maintained

### Key Security Improvements:
1. **Explicit blocking** rather than implicit 404s
2. **Monitoring capability** via X-Blocked-Reason header
3. **Clear error messages** for debugging without exposing internals
4. **Proper ordering** in middleware chain (block dev before allowing static)

## Deployment Requirements
The fix is implemented but requires redeployment to `incomeclarity.ddns.net` to take effect.

## Verification Steps
After deployment:
1. Verify development endpoints return 403 with proper JSON error
2. Check X-Blocked-Reason header is present
3. Confirm static assets still work normally
4. Monitor for any legitimate requests being incorrectly blocked

- `/income-clarity/income-clarity-app/next.config.mjs` - Production configuration
- `/income-clarity/income-clarity-app/lib/middleware/security-headers.ts` - Security headers middleware

## Lessons Learned
1. The original 403 error was actually the security working correctly
2. Development endpoints should always be explicitly blocked in production
3. Clear error messages help distinguish between bugs and security features
4. Middleware ordering matters - security checks should come early in the chain

## Future Considerations
- Consider implementing a development mode toggle for staging environments
- Add monitoring/alerting for blocked endpoint access patterns
- Review other potential development-only endpoints that might need blocking
- Consider rate limiting on error endpoints to prevent information gathering
